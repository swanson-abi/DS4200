    <h3> A Project Introduction: Tasks & Topics</h3>
    <p>The topic we are focusing on for our project highlights the job opportunities in the New York City public sector.
        This particular dataset is important to this project because it provides some interesting insight into
        attributes such
        as salaries, positions available, and timelines of job availability to name a few. We will be able to analyze,
        interpret, and draw conclusions based on the data. Examples of trends we might be able to make inferences about
        are
        the types of jobs that are most in demand, their accessibility, and what types of skills are needed for these
        postings.
        As a whole, this project will encapsulate the job market that New York City provides through a very specific
        lens.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3> Data Introduction: Size, Source & Attributes</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyc-jobs">dataset</a> contains information on job postings from the city of New Yorkâ€™s government job site.
        Each observation contains information on the timeframe of when the job was posted, the salary range,
        a category for the type of job that is created, the number of positions available, and the location
        of the job. The information is collected to help keep track of job postings to help inform New York city
        residents what kind of work opportunities are around New York. The data includes jobs open to city employees
        only as well as public postings. The original dataset has 5,375 rows which we plan to use all of.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dataset we are using initially contained 29 attributes. We removed the attributes whose values dealt with
        addresses. We also removed lengthy descriptive attributes like Job Description and Preferred Skills for
        simplicity.
        We are left with 15 attributes, eleven categorical and four quantitative. </p>

    <p>
        Some analysis questions include the following: how does the salary of the job change based on the number of
        postings
        as well as how this may change based on a specific job category or career level? How does the distribution of
        the number
        of postings change based on the agency that posted them? How does the number of job postings vary based on the
        unit of work,
        and is a unit of work more popular at this time? Which work units are hiring less currently? </p>

    <p>
        To address these analysis questions, we are going to use a mix of both static and interactive plots.
        The types of interactive visualizations that we chose to use are interactive scatter plots, the use
        of radio buttons, heatmaps, as well as drop down options. </p>

    <h3>Navigating NYC Job Trends: Postings, Salaries, and Take-Home Pay Insights:</h3>
    <div class="photos">
        <img src="static_one.png" alt="First static plot">
        <p>The main audience for the graph is students and college-aged people in terms of
            getting
            a better understanding of when exactly jobs might be posted in the NYC area.</p>
        <br />
        <img id="fix" src="static_two.png" alt="Second static plot">
        <p>We felt it
            was important to highlight
            how the salary ranges have changed over time. We also wanted to be able to identify any trends if applicable and
            any changes that may occur
            in conjunction with the job market at that time.</p>
        <br />
        <img id="sep" src="static_four.png" alt="Third static plot">
        <p>This plot takes a look athe average monthly take
            home. This is
            especially important to see through a heatmap given that it makes a visual distinction to the audience.<br />
            The purpose of these static plots were to take a
            deeper dive into
            base salaries, seeing any correlation between salaries increases, and audience specific data.</p>

    <h3>Exploring NYC Salary Trends: Distribution and Career Level Insights:</h3>

    <iframe src="interactive_plot1.html" width="550" height="450"></iframe>
    <p>The graph shows the number of positions posted for each job posting and the average salary that goes along with
        it.
        The different colors represent the career level of the position. Since this is an interactive plot, the user can
        use the input radio to select a color to see
        how the graph may look for each level. When the user selects this, the other points for the career level will
        turn grey. From the graph it is clear that the number
        of positions decreases will the average salary goes up. There is one cluster in the graph between 0-10 number of
        positions and between 50,000-100,000 for the average salary.
        Some of the outliers include a manager position with over 300,000 in average salary as well as a few experienced
        non-manager positions that have a high number of positions.
        There is another small cluster of points that has low number of positions and no average salary.</p>

    <iframe src="overview.html" width="275" height="425"></iframe>
    <p>We can see the distribution of the average salary per year. </p>
    <iframe src="zoom.html" width="1050" height="450"></iframe>
    <p>We can see the mean of the each position's average salary by the career level
        and how it has changed over time. Users can select a year that they might want to look at in this line plot by
        selected a year from the input drop down.</p>
    <p>
        These 2 graphs combine can show us if the distribution/shape of a boxplot of a specific year may have been
        influenced heavily by a specific career level.
        For example, when I select the year 2024, none of the lines intersect and in the boxplot, there is much more
        distribution and many of the outliers are above the fourth quartile. </p>

    <h3>A Summary of our Findings, What Was Learned & Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>
        Things that we could improve upon in the future for this data visualization project would be to find an existing
        data set
        that has overlap with the NYC Job postings to better analyze the data. By doing this, we could compare and
        contrast the two data
        sets to make more distict conclusions about our findings.<br />Another important thing that could be done in the
        future would be to
        look at industry specific skills and make visualizations based on those trends overtime.<br />Finally, making
        visualizations with attributes
        that may not have a lot of overlap to see if there is any distinctive trends.<br /> What we were able to learn
        from creating these
        data visualizations was mainly how to analyze and identify specific categories from large data sets to make
        correlations and working with graphing Python libraries.
